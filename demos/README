Overview
--------

This directory contains various simple tutorial-like demos, which
demonstrate some of the functionality of the the "test machines" in GXemul.

Each directory has a README file, containing examples on how to build and
run the demo programs for various target architectures.


Simple demos:
-------------

  o)  hello		Prints Hello World to the console.

  o)  rectangles	Draws random rectangles to the framebuffer, using
			manual pixel fill-loops.

  o)  disk		Reads sectors from a disk image, and dumps the
			contents in hex and ascii to the console.

  o)  mp                Multi-Processor demo (not very functional yet)


License note
------------

These demos are not under the same license(s) as the rest of GXemul.

The demos, and the testmachine include header files, are public domain, so
you can reuse the code even in projects which have licenses that are
incompatible with the BSD-style licenses used for GXemul itself.
