How to add a new component:
---------------------------

Assuming you want to implement a FooComponent class:

1. Copy a reasonably similar component's .cc file, e.g.
   MIPS_CPUComponent.cc, to FooComponent.cc.

2. Copy MIPS_CPUComponent.h to FooComponent.h.

3. Substitute all occurances of MIPS_CPUComponent with
   FooComponent in the .cc and .h files.

4. Edit Makefile.skel to include FooComponent.o among the
   OBJS to build.

Then run   make clean_all   and   ./configure && make test

Now you can modify the new component to suit your needs.
