How to add new machine types to GXemul:
---------------------------------------

The easiest way is to simply copy an existing machine (e.g. machine_landisk.c)
into whatever you want the new machine to be called (machine_foo.c), update
Makefile.skel to include machine_foo.o in the list of object files to build,
and then change the contents of machine_foo.c.

A machine_*.c file may contain more than one machine specification (e.g.
machine_test.c contains several "bare" and "test" machines), but usually it is
best to think of these files as containing one machine per file.

The main code parts are:

	MACHINE_SETUP(my_machine_name)
	{       
		machine->machine_name = "My Machine Name";

		...

		/*  add devices and busses here  */

		if (!machine->prom_emulation)
			return;

		/*  add prom emulation stuff here, e.g. register
		    contents and memory contents at startup  */
	}

	MACHINE_DEFAULT_CPU(my_machine_name)
	{
		/*  Replace 5Kc with the name of the CPU in
		    the machine you are emulating:  */
		machine->cpu_name = strdup("5Kc");
	}

	MACHINE_DEFAULT_RAM(my_machine_name)
	{
		/*  Set this to the amount of RAM in MB that
		    the machine mode will use by default, unless
		    overridden with the -M option:  */
		machine->physical_ram_in_mb = 64;
	}

	MACHINE_REGISTER(my_machine_name)
	{
		/*  Register the machine name. Change ARCH_MIPS to
		    the desired architecture, and make sure that
		    MACHINE_MY_MACHINE is defined in
		    src/include/machine.h!  */
		MR_DEFAULT(my_machine_name, "My Machine Name",
		    ARCH_MIPS, MACHINE_MY_MACHINE);

		me->set_default_ram = machine_default_ram_my_machine_name;

		/*  Add an alias. This is what will show up in the
		    -H list, and is used by the -E option:  */
		machine_entry_add_alias(me, "my_machine_name");
	}
