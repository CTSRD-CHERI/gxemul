 *  COMMENT: Dreamcast Real-Time Clock
 *
 *  Pretty basic; two 32-bit words at physical addresses 0x00710000 and
 *  0x00710004 hold the high and low 16-bit parts, respectively, of the
 *  system's 32-bit tv_sec value.
 *
 *  The only difference from the raw Unix concept is that the Dreamcast's
 *  clock is based at 1950 instead of 1970.
