/**
 * \brief A base-class for memory-mapped components.
 *
 * A memory-mapped component is a Component which is meant to be mapped
 * into a bus' address space. It has a <b>base offset</b> and a <b>size</b>,
 * which the bus sees. The bus then forwards only those read/write requests
 * to the memory-mapped component that are within that range.
 *
 * There is also an <b>address multiplicator</b>, to handle the common
 * case when a device has, say, N 8-bit registers, but is accessed using
 * memory-mapped addresses that are seen as N 32-bit registers. In this
 * example, the address multiplicator would be 4.
