(P)ROM and BIOS emulation in GXemul:
------------------------------------

The general philosophy that applies to PROM/BIOS emulation is that no raw 
binary dumps of real ROMs should be included in GXemul. It is nicer to 
emulate in software only those parts of a machine's ROM or BIOS that are
actually necessary to boot an operating system.

This directory contains software emulation of various PROMs and BIOSes.

(Note: Running actual PROM dumps is also possible, and of course has
several advantages over software simulated PROM call handling. That
is what GXemul's -Q command line option is for.)
