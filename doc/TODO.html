<h1>GXemul: TODO</h1>
<hr><p>

<a href="./">Back to the index.</a>


<h2>TODO</h2>

<p>Some things, in approximate Time order, that I'd like to implement or fix.
(Things at the top need to be fixed before those at the bottom.)
Some items in this list are perhaps already fixed. This is just a place
for me to do brain-storming.

<p>Please note that GXemul 0.5.0 will be a complete rewrite of GXemul, from
scratch. This file has nothing to do with the TODO files from previous versions
of GXemul.

<p>You may also want to read the preliminary documentation:
<ul>
	<li><a href="index.html">Main documentation</a>
	<li><a href="doxygen/html/index.html">Source code documentation</a>
</ul>

<p>Please see <a href="http://gavare.se/gxemul/">GXemul's homepage</a>
for more information about GXemul in general.

Legacy (0.4.x) series
---------------------

	[ ]  Perhaps release 0.4.6.4, with:
		[ ]  Fixes for PPC instructions?
		[ ]  OF fixes... Try to get FreeBSD/macppc to boot further?

<hr>

Misc.
-----
	[/]  State variables:
		[ ]  Write more unit tests!
		[ ]  Special handlers for Read, Write, Serialize, Deserialize.

	[/]  RAM component:
		[X]  Implement a generic AddressDataBus interface.
		[ ]  STATE! serialize/deserialize, including unit tests

	[/]  Mainbus component:
	        [X]  Forward accesses to individual other devices/components.
		[ ]  Handle overlaps in MakeSureMemoryMapExists some nice way.
		[ ]  AddressDataBus should be extended to allow for direct
		     page mapping.
		[ ]  Unit tests for the above!

	[/]  testmips
		[/]  Work on MIPS_CPUComponent::Run() and the generic
		     CPUComponent
			[X]  Connect the CPU to an AddressDataBus.
			[ ]  virtual to physical translation
			[ ]  Handling of read/write errors?
			[ ]  Both MIPS16 and regular encoding.
			[ ]  Unit tests!
		[ ]  Framebuffer device :-)
		[ ]  Start with SMP early on.
		[ ]  Caches!
		[ ]  Native code generation... etc.

	[ ]  File loader: Load stuff into emulated RAM (or ROM) components.
	     Note: Usually, ELFs contain _virtual_ addresses, so file loading
	     needs to go through a CPU to be properly address translated!
	     BUT BOTH must be possible! I.e. load into RAM, or load into a CPU.
		[ ]  ELF
		[ ]  a.out
		[ ]  raw binaries

	[ ]  Make some initial things in the GUI work:
		[ ]  A window for the text console, including Input line!
		[ ]  Undo/redo status update when necessary
		[ ]  Workspace = show current emulation setup, with a
		     palette on the right-hand side of available components.

	[ ]  Main run loop: Verify that both cycle accurate and larger chunks
	     works well. Unit test?

	[ ]  Keep track of whether the document/emulation is "dirty"?

	[ ]  Components
		[ ]  "help" about components could show a file:/// link to
		     the installed documentation about that component or
		     machine! (If it exists.)

		[ ]  Reintroduce the -e command line option, for "model hint"
		     given to the machine template. (3max, for the decstation
		     type)   Not only for templates. E.g. a MIPS processor, with'
		     subtype "R3000" instead of "5Kc" or so...
		     Perhaps -C too then?

		[ ]  How about aliases? 5000/200, 3max etc. vs pmax/DECstation?
		     Aliases + comments, for templates.

		[ ]  Limit where components can be added. Like "drop targets"?
			E.g. a machine can be added at the root, but a machine can not
			be added on a pcibus. Similarly, a pcibus can not be added
			at the root. It has to be in a machine of some kind.
			Think about this. Perhaps as simple as a "if parent class is
			not blah blah then disallow adding".
				A machine can be added into a dummy component.
				A dummy component can be added into a dummy component.
				A pcibus can be added into a mainbus (in a machine.)
				etc.
			bool IsItOkToAddItToThisProposedParentComponent(propsedParent) const;

	[ ]  Require binary file (or disk image) to be loaded,
	     when starting a template based machine from the command line!
	     	[ ]  Support for reading CD9660, EXT2FS, FFS/UFS, etc!!!
	     	     and reading the binary from there. Autodetect common
	     	     cases:  /netbsd, /bsd, /boot/kernel or /kernel,
	     	     /vmlinu*, etc. If there is only one match, then boot
	     	     that, otherwise require explicit filename on the
	     	     command line (either for a file in an emulated
	     	     filesystem, or a host file).

	[/]  IR: this could be done separately from actual emulation
	     code, and unit tested. src/ir/
		[X]  IRBlockCache, hold a bunch of natively translated chunks
		     of code.
		[ ]  runtime option to turn off native code generation
		     backends.		
		[ ]  IR opcode etc.
			[ ]  Debug dump must be possible.
			[ ]  Load of various types
			[ ]  Store of various types
			[ ]  Arithmetic
			[ ]  Bit logic
			[ ]  Architecture dependent operations (setting/reading
			     status registers, manipulating the TLBs,
			     triggering software interrupts, etc)
			[ ]  Conditional branches
			[ ]  Unconditional branches
			[ ]  Calls to subroutines. Special case for known
			     leaf functions?
			[ ]  Labels. (?)
		     Abstraction framework:
			[ ]  "Run this code"
				NOTE: If no native target is in use, this should
				run the code in plain C++! It is ok for this
				to be not 100% tightly optimized.
			[ ]  Count nr of times a block has been executed;
			     this can be used to go from
			     	1. IR only, to
			     	2. native, but not optimized
			     	3. native, heavily optimized
			     	etc.
			[ ]  Internal helpers such as "mark this as
			     executable in memory".
		[ ]  Initial target: amd64.
			[ ]  Should generate machine code directly in memory,
			     should not depend on any specific assembler's
			     syntax.
		[ ]  Optimizations?
			[ ]  Target-independent?
			[ ]  Per target.
		[/]  Unit tests. (These probably only run if the host
			matches one of the supported targets.)
			E.g. for each IR instruction, and/or for each
			specific optimization.

	[ ]  UnitTest::Assert => macro, so that the correct line number and
		file name ends up in the output. Perhaps
			ASSERT_BOOL(msg, boolexpression)
			ASSERT_STRING(msg, string, expected)
			ASSERT_INT(msg, value, expected)
	     and remove the Assert function(s) entierly?


Actions and undo/redo
---------------------

	[ ]  ModifyStateAction
		Undoable by remembering old value of a state variable.

	[ ]  MoveComponentAction
		Undoable by remembering position, similar to Remove, where
		the component was before.

	[ ]  ResetAction
		Undoable by keeping a clone of the entire old state.

	[ ]  Undo/redo commands should show what they are doing, e.g.
		Undoing "add component"
	     or
	        Redoing "remove component".
	     Preferably even including arguments. :-) Think about this.


CommandInterpreter
------------------

	[ ]  list-components should include the "description" of each
	     component.

	[/]  Tab completion for everything:
		[X]  command names
		[X]  component names
		[ ]  components' state variables
		[/]  "" + TAB = show available names, both commands, components,
		     and variables!
		[ ]  syntax based completion? e.g.:
			help [cmd]   tab completes the first argument as a
				     command
		     This will require a uniform way of describing arguments,
		     and whether or not they should be optional. The tab
		     completer must then parse the command line, including
		     figuring out which arguments were optional, etc.

		     Also, when such syntax is taken into account, the
		     CommandInterpreter can check syntax _before_ running
		     Command::Execute. That means that individual Commands
		     do not have to do manual checking on entry that the
		     number of arguments is correct etc.

			[ ]  filename
			[ ]  command name
			[ ]  component path
			[ ]  optional vs mandatory args...?
			[ ]  scan all commands' args at startup, and have an
				assert() in place, so that unknown arg types
				are caught during development!

	[ ]	move  		Move a component from one path to another.
	[ ]	clearundo	Clears the undo/redo stack (can be used to
				reclaim memory, perhaps... or automatic
				freeing of some of the oldest entries in the
				undo history...?)
	[ ]	inspect component-path	A raw dump of a component's state.
				How about RAM devices? Perhaps "dump" is a
				better command name. "dump ram 0x1234" etc?
	[ ]	copy		copy a component (and its children)
				to the clipboard
	[ ]	paste		paste a component from the clipboard
	[ ]	reset [path]	Reset configuration (i.e. reset all components).
				If no path is given, the root is used as a
				starting point.
	[ ]	print expr  	Prints expression (gets a state variable).
	[ ]	expr = value	Sets a state variable
	[ ]	pause		sets RunState to Paused
	[ ]	step		single-step (Paused)
	[ ]	trace		toggle function call tracing
	[ ]	registers	dump registers of a cpu (short form for
				inspect [focuspath.]cpu  perhaps?)

	[ ]  c, s, r  as abbreviated commands for continue, step, and registers?

	[ ]  "Methods" on objects? E.g. ... ram.read8(addr) returning
	     a byte from that address.

	[ ]  Strings should be supported, both for e.g. variable
	     assignment, and for e.g. placing strings in memory.

	[ ]  Arrays?


Components
----------

	[ ]  Reset. Implement this in practice?

	Start implementing suitable components (src/components/):

		busses/			mainbus, TurboChannel, ISA, PCI, ...
					Busses usually just forward read/write
					accesses to other components.
		cpus/
	[/]		mips
		graphics/		e.g. VGA graphics cards!
		displays/
			rgbmonitor	RGB monitor, for e.g. VGA output.
			lcd		LCD display
			led		A single led :)
		dummy/			dummy components (for unit testing)
		machines/		Machines are usually TEMPLATES which
					set up a couple of other components!
	[/]		testmips
		memory/			Memory keep data in some form of array.
	[/]		ram
			rom		Non-writable during execution? TODO
			cache(s)
		network/		Ethernet and others end up here
		sound/			sound cards


I18N
----

	[ ]  Unit tests to make sure that unicode strings work as expected.
	[/]  Use _(x) everywhere for user-readable strings.
	[ ]  Investigate intltool or gettext or whatever is necessary to get
	     it all working. po directories/files, etc.
	[ ]  Initial translation would be Swedish. LANG=sv_SE.UTF-8 ./gxemul-gui
	[ ]  Use LANG=he_IL.UTF-8 ./gxemul-gui to try a right-to-left languages,
	     or  LANG=ja_JP.UTF-8 ./gxemul-gui to try an asian language.


Error handling
--------------

	[ ]  Stack of errors? With human readable (i18n'd) messages.
	     (e.g. Exception with possibility to add sub-exception-messages...)


GTKMM GUI
---------

	[ ]  --debug and GTKMM? With GTKMM 2.15.5 it fails because of
	     "new" operator collisions.

	[ ]  Make the misc/gxemul-gui.png icon more meaningful!

	[ ]  Command input window!  Make it look nice.

	[ ]  "GXemul" _last_ in the title bar of windows, not first.
		emulation_name - GXemul
		machine_name (VGA) - GXemul
		machine_name (serial console, tty0) - GXemul
		etc.

	[/]  Disable/gray out menu choices and toolbar buttons that are
	     not applicable, e.g. Undo if nothing is Undoable.
	     [ ]  Make sure this is done on ANY change to the ActionStack!

	[/]  Menu bar:
		NOTE: i18n of these! Default names for "File", "Help" etc!
		
		File
			[/]  New ->
				[/]  Blank emulation
				[/]  From template      (e.g. "testmips")
				-----------------------
				[ ]  GXemul instance
			[/]  Open
				[ ]  (Open can show a list of "thumbnails"
					of the workspace plus e.g. one main
					window (such as a VGA display).)
			[ ]  Close
			-----------
			[X]  Save
			[X]  Save as...
			-----------
			[ ]  list of recently used files
			-----------
			[/]  Quit
		Edit
			[/]  Undo
			[/]  Redo
			-----------
			[/]  Cut
			[/]  Copy
			[/]  Paste
			[/]  Delete
			-----------
			[/]  Preferences   (?)
		View
			[ ]  Show toolbar
			[ ]  Show workspace
			[ ]  Show debug console
			[ ]  Full screen mode (F11, CTRL-ALT-F11 to get out)
		Emulation
			[/]  Play/Go
			[/]  Pause
			[ ]  Reset
		Help
			[ ]  Contents  (installed html files)
			[X]  About

	[/]  Toolbar button area:
		Run/step forward (start emulation)
		Pause (pause emulation, button kept down until unpaused)
		Reset (with a dialog asking for confirmation)
		Run/step backwards
		Undo/Redo!
	     (Optional plug-in-ability/extensibility. Buttons should
	     be bound to debugger commands.)

	[ ]  "Workspace", where emulations can be created
	     by drag-n-drop of components from a palette, and/or
	     from other emulations. Normally, the workspace window would
	     be docked in the "center" of the GXemul window, with the
	     palette to the right, and the command window below it.

		[ ]  Main workspace:
			[ ]  Draw all components in the emulation tree,
			     using cairo.
			[ ]  Scrollbars if the whole design area isn't possible
			     to fit in the designated rectangle?
			[ ]  Tooltips for components? (A "summary" of the entire
			     state window.)
		[ ]  Palette window, of all available components.

	[ ]  Copy/Paste of components! Both inside one GXemul instance,
	     and _BETWEEN APPLICATIONS_!

	[ ]  Dockable/undockable windows for machines/devices/
	     I/O-units' contents ?


Think about
-----------

	[ ]  Inspection of state of any Component...

	[ ]  Monitoring of _state transitions_?

	[ ]  Callstack window, etc. (per CPU).

	[ ]  Memory view with machine code disassembler + show source code
	     lines (if available), including current execution point.

	[ ]  Function call trace window (also per CPU).
		[ ]  Ability to "fold" a branch of the tree! Could be useful.
		[ ]  Ability to "fold" _all_ branches that have a specific
		     symbol. E.g. fold all "printf" calls, so that individual
		     putchars are never displayed if they are called from the
		     printf tree, but they will be displayed if they are
		     called from elsewhere.

	[ ]  Profiling using profil()? On host archs that support it.
	     That way, the _generated_ runtime code could be profiled
	     from within the emulator.

	[ ]  ARBITRARY break conditions, i.e. between each instruction,
	     check any number of arbitrary conditions:
		x) Contents of memory locations, even including stuff
		   on the stack
		x) Reads/writes from memory?
		x) Any flags or other device state (registers).

	     This obviously slows things down A LOT, so the default is
	     to have no such break conditions.

	     [ ]  Optionally increase counters instead of breaking,
		  for statistics gathering.  (Of course, it should then be
		  possible to set a break condition such as   expr > 50 or so)

	     [ ]  Compile these conditions into some form of internal
	     	  byte code?

	[ ]  Cache emulation, multiple hierarchies, etc.

	[ ]  Timing modes:
		1) Real-time approximation. (For guest OSes.)
		2) Fixed. (For fixed 1 instruction/cycle speed.)
		   Each device must then have a specified speed (such
		   as 50 MHz...)
	    It should be possible to switch timing modes during an emulation,
	    but going back after such a switch does not have to be possible.

	[ ]  Generic timer framework

	[ ]  Generic interrupt framework

	[ ]  Generic network emulation framework
		[ ]  Support SLIP/PLIP in emulated guest OS?
		[ ]  Connect to real world via:
			[ ]  Built-in NAT layer
			[ ]  Perhaps VDE or similar?

	[ ]  PROM emulation in software: Some kind of plugin system,
	     allowing machines to plug in software PROM emulation packages.

	[ ]  Regular saving of state with time stamps (i.e. cycle numbers),
	     so that running "backwards" is possible!
	     NOTE:
	 	1) This must include network packages and disk image
		   contents! Tricky. But perhaps doable.
		2) Must be possible to use both from the UI (a "step
		   backwards" button?) and the debugger.
	     A kind of "exponential decay"-kind of discarding of old states is
	     probably the best way to do it.
	     Not necessary to be able to save the "Backward state"; saving
	     the state will only save the latest state.

	[ ]  "Live migration" might be possible. Or at least migrating while
	     the emulation is being paused. (Not very live-ish, but perhaps
	     this can be tweaked.)

	[ ]  Actual machines being emulated 1 per process/thread? Or all in the
	     same process/thread?
	     [ ] Try to take advantage of SMP hosts.
	     [ ] Prepare early on for emulation using multiple hosts (or
	     	 GXemul instances)

	[ ]  Full-screen. CTRL-ALT-F11 toggles full-screen vs docked window
	     in the designer view? CTRL-ALT-F12 toggles mouse capture?

	[ ]  There can now be links directly into the documentation,
	     assuming it is installed. ($PREFIX/share/doc/gxemul/*.html)
	     I.e. F1 (and Help->Contents) can cause a web browser to be
	     launched.  F1 in dialogs could link to a page with screenshots
	     + description of each dialog.

	[ ]  Userland emulation!
	     Both from the command line, and from the GUI? (Startable,
	     at least.) Possibility to inspect cache misses, etc.
		-u emulname  should imply -q.

	[ ]  Command-line options compatible with pre-0.5.0! Start e.g.
	     framebuffers in full-screen / windowed mode, _not_ docked.

	[ ]  Hot-swap of devices during runtime, depends on Bus support. e.g.:
		Floppies
		CDROMS
		Some harddisks?
		PCMCIA
		USB
		Serial devices
		Parallel devices
		VGA monitors
		ADB
		Sun's old bus for keyboards/mice
		...

	[ ]  TFTP server built-in into the simulated gateway? For netbooting.

	[ ]  GDB debug connection (again).
	
	[ ]  SuperH emulation: Not only SH4, but SH3 too?


Preparation for release 0.5.0
-----------------------------

	x) Not meaningful until enough functionality from the 0.4.x series have
	   been duplicated. AT LEAST the following before the release:
	   	o) testmips!
		o) working GUI.
	   	o) at least one REAL mips machine, such as pmax!
	 	o) basic debugger commands:
	 		trace tree, single step, registers, etc.
	 	o) some form of native code generation

	x) Carefully read through all the source code.

	x) Build on as many platforms as possible, including running unit tests.

	x) Documentation:
		x) Mention in the documentation the recommended way to do
		   customized distributions of gxemul (by naming the directory
		   gxemul-MyVer-1.2.3 etc, and supplying all source code). +
		   SECONDARY_MSG in misc.h.
		x) Links from component names in the template machine tree
		   dumps, so that e.g. "mips_cpu0" links to mips_cpu?
		x) Automated build of list of CommandInterpreter Commands + long
		   description as HTML?
		x) User guide with screenshots of the new GUI, _BUT_ the
		   instructions should always mention how things are done
		   using the text-only UI as well.
		x) guestoses.html page in the same location as the legacy version,
		   but with links into various Machine pages (where the actual
		   documentation for guest OSes are).

	x) When making a release:
		Make sure to run "make documentation" in the release-named
		directory, so that html documentation about components and
		machines is produced for the Stable version, and not the
		Development version!

	x) Carefully check that the man page reflects the correct
	   command line options etc.

	x) Carefully read through all the documentation, and test all
	   instructions given there.

	x) Take reasonable screenshots of the new version, and place on
	   the homepage. In particular, take a small thumbnail screenshot,
	   and place above the text "Introduction" in the lefthand navigation
	   section, on all pages. (And replace the icon on gavare.se for
	   GXemul with this icon, and perhaps also on Wikipedia?)
		x)  Screenshots of simple bootup of guest OSes (maybe
			even amd64 guest OSes?)
		x)  Screenshots of the GUI, when debugging.
		x)  Screenshots of running in text console mode, e.g.
			booting a netbsd kernel, and then single-stepping.

	x) Make sure that the web page looks reasonable. There should be
	   clear ways to download the old 0.4.x version in addition to
	   the 0.5.0 release, even when 0.5.0 has been released.


General notes for ANY 0.5.x release
-----------------------------------

	x) Mention the RELEASE in the HISTORY file.
	x) Create .tar.gz release package:
		x) remove all .svn directories
		x) run   ./configure; make documentation; make clean_all
	x) Verify that the package builds as expected on one or more machines.
	x) Branch (for 0.5.x) and/or tag (for 0.5.x[.y]) in SVN.
	x) Home page updates:
		x) index.html:
			x) Version numbers
		x) news.html:
			x) Version number, News entry
		x) download.html:
			x) Version numbers
			x) Link to .tar.gz
			x) SourceForge link
			x) RELEASE note excerpt
	x) After rsync:ing, make sure to remove old LATEST_IS_x.x.x.x files!
	x) Once the home page has been updated:
		x) Verify that the .tar.gz is downloadable, and works.
		x) Upload .tar.gz to SourceForge's File Release system
		x) Post message to the gxemul-users mailing list.
		x) Update FreshMeat
		x) Update WikiPedia
