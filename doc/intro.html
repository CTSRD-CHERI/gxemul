<a name="overview"></a>
<h3>Overview</h3>

GXemul is a framework for full-system computer architecture emulation. 
Several processor architectures and machine types have been implemented. 
It is working well enough to allow <a href="#emulmodes">unmodified 
"guest" operating systems to run inside the emulator</a>, as if they were 
running on real hardware.

<p>The emulator emulates (networks of) real machines. The machines may 
consist of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture">MIPS</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_88000">Motorola 88K</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerpc">PowerPC</a>, and <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperH">SuperH</a> processors, and 
various surrounding hardware components such as framebuffers, busses, 
interrupt controllers, ethernet controllers, disk controllers, and serial 
port controllers.

<p>GXemul, including the dynamic translation system, is implemented in C and C++,
which means that the emulator will run on practically any 64-bit or 32-bit
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like">Unix-like</a> systems,
with few or no modifications.

<p>Devices and processors are not simulated with 100% accuracy. They are 
only "faked" well enough to allow guest operating systems to run without 
complaining too much. Still, the emulator could be of interest for 
academic research and experiments, such as when learning how to write 
operating system code.

<p>The emulator contains code which tries to emulate the workings of CPUs
and surrounding hardware found in real machines, but it does not contain
any ROM code. You will need some form of program (in binary form) to run
in the emulator. For some emulation modes, PROM calls are handled by the
emulator itself, so you do not need to use any ROM image at all.

<p>You can use pre-compiled kernels (for example <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a>
kernels, or Linux), or other programs that are in binary format, and in some cases
even actual ROM images. A couple of different file formats are supported:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format">ELF</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.out">a.out</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COFF">COFF</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECOFF">ECOFF</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SREC_%28file_format%29">SREC</a>, and raw binaries.

<p>If you do not have a kernel as a separate file, but you have a bootable
disk image, then it is sometimes possible to boot directly from that
image. This works for example with DECstation emulation, <a href="dreamcast.html">Dreamcast 
emulation</a>, or when booting from generic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO9660">ISO9660</a>
CDROM images if the kernel is included in the image as a plain file.

<p><br>
<a name="free"></a>
<h3>Is GXemul Free software?</h3>

Yes. GXemul is released under a Free license. The code in GXemul is
Copyrighted software, it is <i>not</i> public domain. (If this is
confusing to you, you might want to read up on the definitions of the
four freedoms associated with Free software, <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a>.)

<p>Most of the code is released under a 3-clause BSD-style license
(or "revised BSD-style" if one wants to use <a 
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/bsd.html">GNU jargon</a>). Apart from
the main code, some files are copied from other sources such as
NetBSD, for example header files containing symbolic names of bitfields in
device registers. They are also covered by similar licenses, but with some
additional clauses. The main point, however, is that the licenses require
that the original Copyright and license terms are included when you make a
copy or modification.

<p>If you plan to redistribute GXemul <i>without</i> supplying the source
code, then you need to comply with each individual source file some other
way, for example by writing additional documentation containing copyright
notes. (This is not done in the default distribution, since it is a source 
code distribution. You need to check 
all individual files for details. The <i>easiest way out</i> if you plan 
to redistribute code from GXemul is, of course, to let it remain Free Software
and simply include the source code.)

<p>In case you want to reuse parts of GXemul, but you need to do that 
under a different license (e.g. the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPL</a>), then contact
the author of the files in question to see if the files can be
dual-licensed.





<p><br>
<a name="build"></a>
<h3>How to compile/build the emulator</h3>

Uncompress the .tar.gz distribution file, and run
<pre>
	$ <b>./configure</b>
	$ <b>make</b>
</pre>

<p>This should work on most Unix-like systems. GXemul does not <i>require</i> any 
specific libraries to build, however, having the following libraries available
adds features that are otherwise unavailable:
<ul>
  <li>X11, for graphical framebuffer emulation
  <li><tt>libintl</tt>, for I18N support
</ul>

<p>The emulator's performance is highly dependent on both runtime settings 
and on compiler settings, so you might want to experiment with using 
different <tt>CC</tt>, <tt>CXX</tt>, <tt>CFLAGS</tt>, and <tt>CXXFLAGS</tt>
environment variable values when running the <tt>configure</tt> script.




<p><br>
<a name="run"></a>
<h3>How to run the emulator</h3>

Once you have built GXemul, running it should be rather straight-forward.
Running <tt><b>gxemul</b></tt> without arguments (or with the
<b><tt>-h</tt></b> or <b><tt>-H</tt></b> command line options) will
display a help message.

<p>To get some ideas about what is possible to run in the emulator, please 
read the section about <a href="guestoses.html">installing "guest" 
operating systems</a>. The most straight forward guest operating to 
install is NetBSD/pmax; the instructions provided <a 
href="guestoses.html#netbsdpmaxinstall">here</a> should let you install 
NetBSD/pmax in a way very similar to how it is done on a real DECstation.

<p>If you are interested in using the emulator to develop code on your 
own, then you should also read the section about <a 
href="experiments.html#hello">Hello World</a>.

<p>To exit the emulator, type CTRL-C to enter the 
single-step debugger, and then type <tt><b>quit</b></tt>.

<p>If you are starting an emulation by entering settings directly on the 
command line, and you are not using the <tt><b>-x</b></tt> option, then 
all terminal input and output will go to the main controlling terminal. 
CTRL-C is used to break into the debugger, so in order to send CTRL-C to 
the running (emulated) program, you may use CTRL-B. (This should be a 
reasonable compromise to allow the emulator to be usable even on systems 
without X Windows.)

<p>There is no way to send an actual CTRL-B to the emulated program, when 
typing in the main controlling terminal window. The solution is to either 
use <a href="configfiles.html">configuration files</a>, or use 
<tt><b>-x</b></tt>. Both these solutions cause new xterms to be opened for 
each emulated serial port that is written to. CTRL-B and CTRL-C both have 
their original meaning in those xterm windows.





<p><br>
<a name="cpus"></a>
<h3>Which processor architectures does GXemul emulate?</h3>

The architectures that are emulated well enough to let at least one 
guest operating system run (per architecture) are 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM</a>,   
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture">MIPS</a>,   
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_88000">Motorola 88K</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerpc">PowerPC</a>, and   
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperH">SuperH</a>.

<p>Please read the sections about <a href="#emulmodes">emulation 
modes</a> and <a href="guestoses.html">guest operating
systems</a> for more information about the machines and operating systems, 
respectively, that can be considered "working" in the emulator.

<p>(There is some code in GXemul for emulation of other architectures, but
they are not stable or complete enough to be listed among the "working"
architectures.)






<p><br>
<a name="hosts"></a>
<h3>Which host architectures/platforms are supported?</h3>

GXemul should compile and run on any modern host architecture (64-bit or 
32-bit word-length). It is mostly tested on
<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/platforms/amd64.html">FreeBSD/amd64</a> 7.x,
and sometimes also on
<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/platforms/alpha.html">FreeBSD/alpha</a> 4.9,
Linux (various platforms), and every
now and then also on <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a> or
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> inside the emulator itself
(various platforms).

<p>Note 1: The <a href="translation.html">dynamic translation</a> engine 
does <i>not</i> require backends for native code generation to be written 
for each individual host architecture; the intermediate representation 
that the dyntrans system uses can be executed on any host architecture.

<p>Note 2: Although GXemul may build and run on non-Unix-like platforms,
such as <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>, Unix-like systems are
the primary platform. Some functionality may be lost when running on Cygwin.








<p><br>
<a name="accuracy"></a>
<h3>Emulation accuracy</h3>

GXemul is an instruction-level emulator; things that would happen in
several steps within a real CPU are not taken into account (e.g. pipe-line
stalls or out-of-order execution). Still, instruction-level accuracy seems
to be enough to be able to run complete guest operating systems inside the
emulator.

<p>The existance of instruction and data caches is "faked" to let
operating systems think that they are there, but for all practical
purposes, these caches are non-working.

<p>The emulator is in general <i>not</i> timing-accurate, neither at the
instruction level nor on any higher level. An attempt is made to let
emulated clocks run at the same speed as the host (i.e. an emulated timer
running at 100 Hz will interrupt around 100 times per real second), but
since the host speed may vary, e.g. because of other running processes,
there is no guarantee as to how many instructions will be executed in
each of these 100 Hz cycles.

<p>If the host is very slow, the emulated clocks might even lag behind
the real-world clock.






<p><br>
<a name="emulmodes"></a>
<h3>Which machines does GXemul emulate?</h3>

A few different machine types are emulated. The following machine types 
are emulated well enough to run at least one "guest OS":

<p>

    <li><b>IBM 6050/6070 (PReP, PowerPC Reference Platform)</b> (<a href="guestoses.html#netbsdprepinstall">NetBSD/prep</a>)
    <li><b>MacPPC (generic "G4" Macintosh)</b> (<a href="guestoses.html#netbsdmacppcinstall">NetBSD/macppc</a>)
    <li><b>Artesyn PM/PPC</b> <font color="#0000e0">(<super>*2</super>)</font>
	(<a href="guestoses.html#netbsdpmppc">NetBSD/pmppc</a>)
  </ul>
  <p>
  <li><b><u>SuperH</u></b>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Sega Dreamcast</b> (<a href="dreamcast.html#netbsd_generic_md">NetBSD/dreamcast</a>, <a href="dreamcast.html#linux_live_cd">Linux/dreamcast</a>)
    <li><b>Landisk I-O DATA USL-5P</b> (<a href="guestoses.html#openbsdlandiskinstall">OpenBSD/landisk</a>)
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>
<small><font color="#0000e0">(<super>*1</super>)</font> =
Linux/Malta may be run as a guest OS, however I have not yet found any stable
URL to pre-compiled Linux/Malta kernels. Thus, Linux/Malta emulation is not
tested for every release of the emulator; sometimes it works, sometimes
it doesn't.</small>

<br><small><font color="#0000e0">(<super>*2</super>)</font> =
The emulation is enough for root-on-nfs, but no disk controller (SCSI nor 
IDE) is emulated yet for this machine type.</small>

<p>Note that of all of the machines above, none of them is emulated to 
100%. The most complete emulation mode is probably the DECstation 
5000/200. Things that will most likely <b>not</b> work include running 
raw PROM images for most machines, SGI IRIX, MacOS X or Darwin, Windows 
NT, or Dreamcast games.

<p>There is code in GXemul for emulation of several other machine types; the
degree to which these work range from almost being able to run a complete
OS, to almost completely unsupported, perhaps just enough support to
output a few boot messages via serial console. (See the end of
<a href="guestoses.html#generalnotes">this section</a> on the Guest OSes 
page for some examples, but remember that these do not necessarily work.)

<p>In addition to emulating real machines, there is also a "test-machine".
A test-machine consists of one or more CPUs and a few experimental devices
such as:

<p>
<ul>
  <li>a console I/O device (putchar() and getchar()...)
  <li>an inter-processor communication device, for SMP experiments
  <li>a very simple linear framebuffer device (for graphics output)
  <li>a simple disk controller
  <li>a simple ethernet controller
  <li>a simple interrupt controller
  <li>a real-time clock device
</ul>

<p>This mode is useful if you wish to run experimental code, but do not
wish to target any specific real-world machine type, for example for
educational purposes.

<p>You can read more about these experimental devices <a
href="experiments.html#expdevices">here</a>.
