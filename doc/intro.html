<h1>GXemul: Introduction</h1>
<hr><p>

<a href="./">Back to the index.</a>



<p><br><h3><a name="whatisgxemul">What is GXemul?</a></h3>

<p>GXemul is an experimental framework for full-system 
emulation/virtualization. Several <a href="machines.html">machines</a> 
and other <a href="components.html">components</a> that make up a computer 
system have been implemented, and the framework is designed so that it 
should be relatively easy to add new machine and component types.

<p>GXemul 0.5.0 is a complete rewrite of GXemul in <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a>. Previous versions 
were written in <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29">C</a>.

<p>Thanks to (in no specific order) Ryan Blair, Hollis Blanchard, Joachim 
Buss, Olivier Houchard, Juli Mallett, Juan Romero Pardines, Carl van 
Schaik, Miod Vallat, Alec Voropay, Nils Weller, GÃ¶ran Weinholt, Alexander 
Yurchenko, and everyone else who has provided me with feedback on this and 
previous releases of GXemul.

<p>GXemul's homepage is <a href="http://gavare.se/gxemul/">http://gavare.se/gxemul/</a>.

<p>If you have questions about GXemul, please send mail to one of the
mailing lists: <a 
href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=gxemul-devel"><tt>gxemul-devel</tt></a>
for (technical) discussions about the development of GXemul, or <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=gxemul-users"><tt>gxemul-users</tt></a>
for general user questions.

<p>You may also send feedback directly to me (<tt>anders@gavare.se</tt>),
if you feel that that is more appropriate, or join the IRC channel
<tt>#GXemul</tt> on <a href="http://freenode.net/">FreeNode</a>.




<p><br><h3><a name="build">How to build/install GXemul</a></h3>

<p>If you are lucky, your OS vendor has already packaged GXemul for your
particular platform. If so, then please refer to your OS on how to
download/install GXemul. E.g. on <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>,
you would usually execute<pre>
	<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pkg_add&apropos=0&sektion=0&format=html">pkg_add</a> -r <a href="http://www.freshports.org/emulators/gxemul/">gxemul</a>

	or

	cd <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/emulators/gxemul/">/usr/ports/emulators/gxemul</a>; make install
</pre>
as root. That will install GXemul, either as a pre-build binary package,
or from the <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/ports/">FreeBSD Ports system</a>.

<p>Another example is on <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</a>,
where the corresponding command line is:<pre>
	apt-get install <a href="http://packages.debian.org/gxemul">gxemul</a>
</pre>

<p>However, there are several reasons why you might want to build
directly from source code:
<ul>
	<li>GXemul may not be available as a pre-built package for your OS.
	<li>GXemul may be available for your OS, but only an older version.
	<li>You simply feel like compiling from source code directly, perhaps
		because you want to modify the source code.
	<li>You may not have root access on your machine, so you cannot
		install the GXemul package from the OS vendor system-wide.
</ul>

<p>If you want to build from source code, you should
<a href="http://gavare.se/gxemul/download.html">download the GXemul 
distribution from the home page</a> and run:<pre>
	./configure
	make
</pre>

<p>This should work on most Unix-like platforms. If it does 
not work for you, then please mail me a detailed bug report, including
the output of <tt>uname -a</tt>, the <tt>configure</tt> and <tt>make</tt>
output, and any other useful information.
(Using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygwin">Cygwin</a>
might work as well, but this is not really supported.)

<p>GXemul depends on the following external libraries and tools:
<ul>
        <li>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gtkmm">gtkmm</a>
		libraries and header files (gtkmm-2.4 >= 2.12.5),
                for the GUI.
        <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxygen">Doxygen</a>, 
		for building C++ class documentation.
</ul>

<p>Note, however, that both gtkmm and Doxygen are <i>optional</i>
dependencies. GXemul will build without them. If gtkmm is missing, the
<tt>gxemul-gui</tt> binary will not work, but you can still use the 
text-only variant, <tt>gxemul</tt>. If Doxygen is missing, the
installed documentation will not include the
<a href="doxygen/html/index.html">source code reference</a>.

<p>If the build succeeded, there will be two binaries, <tt>gxemul</tt> and
<tt>gxemul-gui</tt>. These should work as they are, they do not have to be
installed anywhere, but for convenience, there is a makefile target which
installs binaries and other files:

<p>To install, type <tt>make install</tt>. This installs binaries,
man pages, and documentation under <tt>/usr/local</tt>, unless the
<tt>PREFIX</tt> environment variable was set prior to running
<tt>configure</tt>. (You need to have write permission to the 
corresponding directories to do this.)





<p><br><h3><a name="free">Is GXemul Free software?</a></h3>

Yes. GXemul is released under a Free license. The code in GXemul is
Copyrighted software, it is <i>not</i> public domain. (If this is
confusing to you, you might want to read up on the definitions of the
four freedoms associated with Free software, <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a>.)

<p>The main part of the code is released under a 3-clause BSD-style 
license (or "revised BSD-style" if one wants to use <a 
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/bsd.html">GNU jargon</a>). Apart from 
this, some files are copied from other sources such as NetBSD, for example 
header files containing symbolic names of bitfields in device registers. 
They are also covered by similar licenses, but with some additional 
clauses. The main point, however, is that the licenses require that the 
original Copyright and license terms are included when you make a copy or 
modification.

<p>If you plan to redistribute GXemul <i>without</i> supplying the source
code, then you need to comply with each individual source file some other
way, for example by writing additional documentation containing copyright
notes. I have not done this, since I do not plan on making distributions
without source code. You need to check all individual files for details.
The "easiest way out" if you plan to redistribute GXemul is, of
course, to let it remain Free Software and simply include the source code.

<p>In case you want to reuse parts of GXemul, but you need to do that 
under a different license (e.g. the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPL</a>), then contact me and 
I can probably re-license/dual-license files on a case-by-case basis.
