<h3>Speed and emulation modes</h3>

So, how fast is GXemul? There is no short answer to this. There is 
especially no answer to the question <b>What is the slowdown factor?</b>, 
because the host architecture and emulated architecture can usually not be 
compared just like that.

<p>Performance depends on several factors, including (but not limited to)  
host architecture, target architecture, host clock speed, which compiler
and compiler flags were used to build the emulator, what the workload is,
what additional runtime flags are given to the emulator, and so on.

<p>Devices are generally not timing-accurate: for example, if an emulated
operating system tries to read a block from disk, from its point of view
the read was instantaneous (no waiting). So 1 MIPS in an emulated OS might
have taken more than one million instructions on a real machine.

<p>Also, if the emulator says it has executed 1 million instructions, and 
the CPU family in question was capable of scalar execution (i.e. one cycle 
per instruction), it might still have taken more than 1 million cycles on 
a real machine because of cache misses and similar micro-architectural 
penalties that are not simulated by GXemul.

<p>Because of these issues, it is in my opinion best to measure
performance as the actual (real-world) time it takes to perform a task
with the emulator, e.g.:

<ul>
  <li>"How long does it take to install NetBSD onto a disk image?"
  <li>"How long does it take to compile XYZ inside NetBSD
	in the emulator?".
</ul>

<p>So, how fast is it? :-)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answer: it varies.

<a name="net"></a>
<h3>Networking</h3>

<font color="#ff0000">NOTE/TODO: This section is very old.</font>

<p>Running an entire operating system under emulation is very interesting
in itself, but for several reasons, running a modern OS without access to
TCP/IP networking is a bit akward. Hence, I feel the need to implement
TCP/IP (networking) support in the emulator.

<p>
As far as I have understood it, there seems to be two different ways to go:

<ol>
  <li>Forward ethernet packets from the emulated ethernet controller to
	the host machine's ethernet controller, and capture incoming 
	packets on the host's controller, giving them back to the
	emulated OS. Characteristics are:
	<ul>
	  <li>Requires <i>direct</i> access to the host's NIC, which
		means on most platforms that the emulator cannot be
		run as a normal user!
	  <li>Reduced portability, as not every host operating system
		uses the same programming interface for dealing with
		hardware ethernet controllers directly.
	  <li>When run on a switched network, it might be problematic to
		connect from the emulated OS to the OS running on the
		host, as packets sent out on the host's NIC are not
		received by itself. (?)
	  <li>All specific networking protocols will be handled by the
		physical network.
	</ul>
  <p>
  or
  <p>
  <li>Whenever the emulated ethernet controller wishes to send a packet,
	the emulator looks at the packet and creates a response. Packets
	that can have an immediate response never go outside the emulator,
	other packet types have to be converted into suitable other
	connection types (UDP, TCP, etc). Characteristics:
	<ul>
	  <li>Each packet type sent out on the emulated NIC must be handled.
		This means that I have to do a lot of coding.
		(I like this, because it gives me an opportunity to
		learn about networking protocols.)
	  <li>By not relying on access to the host's NIC directly,
		portability is maintained. (It would be sad if the networking
		portion of a portable emulator isn't as portable as the
		rest of the emulator.)
	  <li>The emulator can be run as a normal user process, does
		not require root privilegies.
	  <li>Connecting from the emulated OS to the host's OS should
		not be problematic.
	  <li>The emulated OS will experience the network just as a single
		machine behind a NAT gateway/firewall would. The emulated
		OS is thus automatically protected from the outside world.
	</ul>
</ol>

<p>
Some emulators/simulators use the first approach, while others use the 
second. I think that SIMH and QEMU are examples of emulators using the 
first and second approach, respectively.

<p>
Since I have choosen the second kind of implementation, I have to write 
support explicitly for any kind of network protocol that should be
supported. As of 2004-07-09, the following has been implemented and seems 
to work under at least NetBSD/pmax and OpenBSD/pmax under DECstation 5000/200
emulation (-E dec -e 3max):

<p>
<ul>
  <li>ARP requests sent out from the emulated NIC are interpreted,
	and converted to ARP responses. (This is used by the emulated OS
	to find out the MAC address of the gateway.)
  <li>ICMP echo requests (that is the kind of packet produced by the
	<b><tt>ping</tt></b> program) are interpreted and converted to ICMP echo
	replies, <i>regardless of the IP address</i>. This means that
	running ping from within the emulated OS will <i>always</i>
	receive a response. The ping packets never leave the emulated
	environment.
  <li>UDP packets are interpreted and passed along to the outside world.
	If the emulator receives an UDP packet from the outside world, it
	is converted into an UDP packet for the emulated OS. (This is not
	implemented very well yet, but seems to be enough for nameserver
	lookups, tftp file transfers, and NFS mounts using UDP.)
  <li>TCP packets are interpreted one at a time, similar to how UDP 
	packets are handled (but more state is kept for each connection).
	<font color="#ff0000">NOTE: Much of the TCP handling code is very
	ugly and hardcoded.</font>
<!--
  <li>RARP is not implemented yet. (I haven't needed it so far.)
-->
</ul>

<p>
The gateway machine, which is the only "other" machine that the emulated 
OS sees on its emulated network, works as a NAT-style firewall/gateway. It 
usually has a fixed IPv4 address of <tt>10.0.0.254</tt>. An OS running in 
the emulator would usually have an address of the form <tt>10.x.x.x</tt>;
a typical choice would be <tt>10.0.0.1</tt>.

<p>
Inside emulated NetBSD/pmax or OpenBSD/pmax, running the following 
commands should configure the emulated NIC:
<pre>
	# <b>ifconfig le0 10.0.0.1</b>
	# <b>route add default 10.0.0.254</b>
	add net default: gateway 10.0.0.254
</pre>

<p>
If you want nameserver lookups to work, you need a valid /etc/resolv.conf 
as well:
<pre>
	# <b>echo nameserver 129.16.1.3 > /etc/resolv.conf</b>
</pre>
(But replace <tt>129.16.1.3</tt> with the actual real-world IP address of 
your nearest nameserver.)

<p>
Now, host lookups should work:
<pre>
	# <b>host -a www.netbsd.org</b>
	Trying null domain
	rcode = 0 (Success), ancount=2
	The following answer is not authoritative:
	The following answer is not verified as authentic by the server:
	www.netbsd.org  86400 IN        AAAA    2001:4f8:4:7:290:27ff:feab:19a7
	www.netbsd.org  86400 IN        A       204.152.184.116
	For authoritative answers, see:

	netbsd.org      83627 IN        NS      adns2.berkeley.edu
	netbsd.org      83627 IN        NS      uucp-gw-1.pa.dec.com
	Additional information:
	ns.netbsd.org   83627 IN        A       204.152.184.164

	uucp-gw-2.pa.dec.com	172799 IN	A	204.123.2.19
</pre>

<p>
At this point, UDP and TCP should (mostly) work.

<p>
Here is an example of how to configure a server machine and an emulated 
client machine for sharing files via NFS:

<p>
(This is very useful if you want to share entire directory trees
between the emulated environment and another machine. These instruction
will work for FreeBSD, if you are running something else, use your
imagination to modify them.)

<p>
<ul>
  <li>On the server, add a line to your /etc/exports file, exporting
	the files you wish to use in the emulator:<pre>
	<b>/tftpboot -mapall=nobody -ro 123.11.22.33</b>
</pre>
	where 123.11.22.33 is the IP address of the machine running the
	emulator process, as seen from the outside world.
  <p>
  <li>Then start up the programs needed to serve NFS via UDP. Note the
	-n argument to mountd. This is needed to tell mountd to accept
	connections from unprivileged ports (because the emulator does
	not need to run as root).<pre>
	# <b>portmap</b>
	# <b>nfsd -u</b>       &lt;--- u for UDP
	# <b>mountd -n</b>
</pre>
  <li>In the guest OS in the emulator, once you have ethernet and IPv4
	configured so that you can use UDP, mounting the filesystem
	should now be possible:  (this example is for NetBSD/pmax
	or OpenBSD/pmax)<pre>
	# <b>mount -o ro,-r=1024,-w=1024,-U,-3 my.server.com:/tftpboot /mnt</b>
    or
	# <b>mount my.server.com:/tftpboot /mnt</b>
</pre>
	If you don't supply the read and write sizes, there is a risk
	that the default values are too large. The emulator currently
	does not handle fragmentation/defragmentation of <i>outgoing</i>
	packets, so going above the ethernet frame size (1518) is a very
	bad idea. Incoming packets (reading from nfs) should work, though,
	for example during an NFS install.
</ul>

The example above uses read-only mounts. That is enough for things like
letting NetBSD/pmax or OpenBSD/pmax install via NFS, without the need for
a CDROM ISO image. You can use a read-write mount if you wish to share
files in both directions, but then you should be aware of the 
fragmentation issue mentioned above.

<a name="devices"></a>
<h3>Emulation of hardware devices</h3>

<font color="#ff0000">NOTE/TODO: This section is very old, and is about
the legacy framework. New machines and devices should be implemented using the
new <a href="doxygen/html/classComponent.html">Component</a> framework.</font>

<p>Each file called <tt>dev_*.c</tt> in the 
<a href="../src/devices/"><tt>src/devices/</tt></a> directory is
responsible for one hardware device. These are used from
<a href="../src/machines/"><tt>src/machines</tt></a><tt>/machine_*.c</tt>,
when initializing which hardware a particular machine model will be using,
or when adding devices to a machine using the <tt>device()</tt> command in
<a href="configfiles.html">configuration files</a>.

<p>(I'll be using the name "<tt>foo</tt>" as the name of the device in all
these examples.  This is pseudo code, it might need some modification to
actually compile and run.)

<p>Each device should have the following:

<p>
<ul>
  <li>A <tt>devinit</tt> function in <tt>src/devices/dev_foo.c</tt>. It
	would typically look something like this:
<pre>
	DEVINIT(foo)
	{
	        struct foo_data *d;

		CHECK_ALLOCATION(d = malloc(sizeof(struct foo_data)));
	        memset(d, 0, sizeof(struct foo_data));

		/*
		 *  Set up stuff here, for example fill d with useful
		 *  data. devinit contains settings like address, irq path,
		 *  and other things.
		 *
		 *  ...
		 */

		INTERRUPT_CONNECT(devinit->interrupt_path, d->irq);
        
	        memory_device_register(devinit->machine->memory, devinit->name,
	            devinit->addr, DEV_FOO_LENGTH,
	            dev_foo_access, (void *)d, DM_DEFAULT, NULL);
        
		/*  This should only be here if the device
		    has a tick function:  */
		machine_add_tickfunction(machine, dev_foo_tick, d,
		    FOO_TICKSHIFT);

		/*  Return 1 if the device was successfully added.  */
	        return 1;       
	}       
</pre><br>

	<p><tt>DEVINIT(foo)</tt> is defined as <tt>int devinit_foo(struct devinit *devinit)</tt>,
	and the <tt>devinit</tt> argument contains everything that the device driver's
	initialization function needs.

  <p>
  <li>At the top of <tt>dev_foo.c</tt>, the <tt>foo_data</tt> struct
	should be defined.
<pre>
	struct foo_data {
		struct interrupt	irq;
		/*  ...  */
	}
</pre><br>
	(There is an exception to this rule; some legacy code and other
	ugly hacks have their device structs defined in
	<tt>src/include/devices.h</tt> instead of <tt>dev_foo.c</tt>.
	New code should not add stuff to <tt>devices.h</tt>.)
  <p>
  <li>If <tt>foo</tt> has a tick function (that is, something that needs to be
	run at regular intervals) then <tt>FOO_TICKSHIFT</tt> and a tick 
	function need to be defined as well:
<pre>
	#define FOO_TICKSHIFT		14

	DEVICE_TICK(foo)
	{
		struct foo_data *d = extra;

		if (.....)
			INTERRUPT_ASSERT(d->irq);
		else
			INTERRUPT_DEASSERT(d->irq);
	}
</pre><br>

  <li>Does this device belong to a standard bus?
	<ul>
	  <li>If this device should be detectable as a PCI device, then
		glue code should be added to
		<tt>src/devices/bus_pci.c</tt>.
	  <li>If this is a legacy ISA device which should be usable by
		any machine which has an ISA bus, then the device should
		be added to <tt>src/devices/bus_isa.c</tt>.
	</ul>
  <p>
  <li>And last but not least, the device should have an access function.
	The access function is called whenever there is a load or store
	to an address which is in the device' memory mapped region. To
	simplify things a little, a macro <tt>DEVICE_ACCESS(x)</tt>
	is expanded into<pre>
	int dev_x_access(struct cpu *cpu, struct memory *mem,
	    uint64_t relative_addr, unsigned char *data, size_t len,
	    int writeflag, void *extra)
</pre>	The access function can look like this:
<pre>
	DEVICE_ACCESS(foo)
	{
		struct foo_data *d = extra;
		uint64_t idata = 0, odata = 0;

		if (writeflag == MEM_WRITE)
			idata = memory_readmax64(cpu, data, len);

		switch (relative_addr) {

		/*  Handle accesses to individual addresses within
		    the device here.  */

		/*  ...  */

		}

		if (writeflag == MEM_READ)
			memory_writemax64(cpu, data, len, odata);

		/*  Perhaps interrupts need to be asserted or
		    deasserted:  */
		dev_foo_tick(cpu, extra);

		/*  Return successfully.  */
		return 1;
	}
</pre><br>
</ul>

<p>
The return value of the access function has until 2004-07-02 been a 
true/false value; 1 for success, or 0 for device access failure. A device 
access failure (on MIPS) will result in a DBE exception.

<p>
Some devices are converted to support arbitrary memory latency
values. The return value is the number of cycles that the read or 
write access took. A value of 1 means one cycle, a value of 10 means 10 
cycles. Negative values are used for device access failures, and the 
absolute value of the value is then the number of cycles; a value of -5 
means that the access failed, and took 5 cycles.

<p>
To be compatible with pre-20040702 devices, a return value of 0 is treated 
by the caller (in <tt>src/memory_rw.c</tt>) as a value of -1.
