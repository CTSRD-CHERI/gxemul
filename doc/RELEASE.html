<h2>Release notes for GXemul 0.5.0</h2>

<p><i>Copyright (C) 2003-2008  Anders Gavare</i>


<p><br>GXemul is a framework for full-system computer architecture emulation. 
<!-- TODO: More. -->


<p><br>The changes between release 0.4.6.x and 0.5.0 are:

<ul>

  <li>GXemul 0.5.0 is a complete rewrite of the emulator, from scratch.
  	This has the following consequences:
  	<p><ul>
  		<li>All emulation modes, processor implementations,
  			device implementations, and other features were removed.
  		<li>Some processors, devices etc. have then been reimplemented,
  			but not all.
  	</ul>
	<br>(Previous versions were written in C. This version of GXemul
	is written in C++.)
  <p>
  <li>A preliminary GTK+ GUI is now built-in.
  <p>
  <li>There are now finally <tt>install</tt> and <tt>uninstall</tt>
	makefile targets, which should simplify installation.
</ul>

<p><br>To build GXemul, you may need the following:
<ul>
	<li>The gtkmm libraries and header files (gtkmm-2.4 >= 2.12.5),
		for the GUI.
	<li>Doxygen, for building C++ class documentation.
</ul>

<p>Both gtkmm and Doxygen are optional, GXemul will build without them.

<p>To build the emulator, run the <tt>configure</tt> script, and then run 
<tt>make</tt>. This should work on most Unix-like systems, with few or no 
modifications to the source code.


<p><br>Regarding files in the <tt>src/include/thirdparty</tt>
directory: these are from sources outside of GXemul (such as NetBSD). 
The license texts in most cases say that "All advertising materials mentioning
features  or use of this software" must display acknowledgements. Even though I do 
<i>not</i> feel that I mention features or use of the header files (the 
"software") in any advertising materials, I am still very grateful for the 
fact that these people have made their files available for re-use, as Free 
software, so regardless of legal requirements, I guess thanking them like 
this is in order:<pre>
	debug_new.h, fast_mutex.h, and static_assert.h:
		Copyright (C) 2004-2005 by Wu Yongwei.
		(Also src/main/debug_new.cc.)

	exec_elf.h:
		This product includes software developed by the NetBSD
		Foundation, Inc. and its contributors.
</pre>

GXemul or reuse code.
