<h1>Release notes for GXemul 0.6.0</h1>

<p><i>Copyright (C) 2003-2010  Anders Gavare</i>

<p><br>GXemul is a framework for full-system computer architecture emulation. 
Several processor architectures and machine types have been implemented. 
It is working well enough to allow <a href="guestoses.html">unmodified
"guest" operating systems to run inside the emulator</a>,
as if they were running on real hardware.

<p>The emulator emulates (networks of) real machines. The machines may consist
of ARM, MIPS, Motorola 88K, PowerPC, and SuperH processors, and various 
surrounding hardware components such as framebuffers, busses, interrupt 
controllers, ethernet controllers, disk controllers, and serial port 
controllers.

<p>The <a href="index.html">documentation</a> lists the machines and
guest operating systems that 
can be regarded as "working" in GXemul. The best working guest operating 
system is <a href="guestoses.html#netbsdpmaxinstall">NetBSD/pmax</a>.


<p><br>The main change between release 0.4.7.2 and 0.6.0 is:

<ul>
  <li>A new emulation framework, written from scratch (in C++), is now
  	beginning to take shape. So far, <i>only the
	<a href="machines/machine_testm88k.html">testm88k</a> machine mode</i>
	has been rewritten to use the new framework, all other machine modes
	run in legacy mode using the old framework.
	<p>The new <tt>testm88k</tt> mode is much less complete than the old
	<tt>testm88k</tt>; the reason for concentrating on this mode is to be able
	to make an initial release of the new framework within a reasonable
	time frame.
	<p>There is also a (bogus) <tt>testmips</tt> machine which will be
	implemented using the new framework. To use the old <tt>testmips</tt>
	machine, please use the name <tt>oldtestmips</tt> instead.
</ul>

<p>In addition to the new framework, a couple of other changes are worth
mentioning:

<ul>

  <li>Many unused, rarely used, and bogus emulation modes and features
  	were removed, to reduce the maintenance burden.

  <p>
  <li>New source code (but not the legacy part) is
  	<a href="doxygen/html/index.html">documented using Doxygen comments</a>,
  	and there is a unit testing framework in place.

  <p>
  <li>There is now finally an <tt>install</tt> Makefile target, and
  	the <tt>-j</tt> make option can be used to parallelize builds.
  
</ul>


<p><br>Please read the HISTORY file for more details.

<p><br>Files included in this release are:<pre>
    HISTORY                       Detailed revision history / changelog.
    LICENSE                       Copyright message / license.
    README                        Quick start instructions, for the impatient.
    configure, Makefile.skel      sh and make scripts for building GXemul.
    demos/                        Tutorial-like demos of testmachine functionality.
    <a href="index.html">doc/</a>                          Documentation. (*)
    doc/RELEASE.html              This file.
    <a href="TODO.html">doc/TODO</a>                      TODO notes.
    experiments/                  Experimental code. (Usually not needed.)
    man/                          Man page.
    src/                          Source code.
    test/                         Files used for testing.
</pre>

<p>(*) Note: In general, the documentation refers to how things worked
in pre-0.6.0 releases.

<p>To build the emulator, run the <tt>configure</tt> script, and then run 
<tt>make</tt>. This should hopefully work on most Unix-like systems, with few
or no modifications to the source code.

<p>Regarding files in the <tt>src/include/</tt> directory: only some of 
these are written by me, the rest are from other sources
(such as <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a>).
The license text says that "All advertising materials mentioning features 
or use of this software" must display acknowledgements. Even though I do 
<i>not</i> feel that I mention features or use of the header files (the 
"software") in any advertising materials, I am still very grateful for the 
fact that these people have made their files available for re-use, as Free 
software, so regardless of legal requirements, I guess thanking them like
