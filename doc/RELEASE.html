<p><br><a name="about"><h3>About GXemul</h3></a>

GXemul is a framework for full-system computer architecture emulation. 
<!-- TODO: More. -->



<p><br><a name="changes"><h3>Changes</h3></a>

The changes between release 0.4.6.x and 0.5.0 are:

<ul>

  <li>GXemul 0.5.0 is a complete rewrite of the emulator, from scratch.
  	This has the following consequences:
  	<p><ul>
  		<li>All emulation modes, processor implementations,
  			device implementations, and other features were removed.
  		<li>Some processors, devices etc. have then been reimplemented,
  			but not all.
  	</ul>
  <p>
  <li>A GTK+ GUI is now built-in.
  <p>
  <li>There are now finally <tt>install</tt> and <tt>uninstall</tt>
	makefile targets, which should simplify installation.
</ul>

<p><br>To build GXemul, you may need the following:
<ul>
	<li>The gtkmm libraries and header files (gtkmm-2.4 >= 2.12.7),
		for the GUI.
	<li>Doxygen, for building C++ class documentation.
</ul>

<p>Both gtkmm and Doxygen are optional, GXemul will build without them.

<p>To build the emulator, run the <tt>configure</tt> script, and then run 
<tt>make</tt>. This should work on most Unix-like systems, with few or no 
modifications to the source code.



<p><br><a name="first"><h3>Personal "firsts"</h3></a>

For me, personally, the GXemul 0.5.0 development and release has been
a "first" in several areas and technologies:

<ul>
	<li>This is my first realistically-sized application in <b>C++</b>,
		released to the public.
		(Previous versions of GXemul were written in C.)
	<li>I'm using <b>Doxygen</b> to document the source code; previously
		source code documentation was not that rigorous.
	<li>I've switched from using CVS as the repository system for
		source code to <b>SVN</b>. The repository is now also available
		for anonymous read access by anyone.
	<li>This is my first released application which uses a <b>GUI</b>
		(written using GTKMM).
	<li>This is the first time I try to use a <b>Model-view-controller</b>
		approach from the start.
	<li>I've been writing integrated <b>unit tests</b> from the start.
	<li>This is my first application which supports <b>Undo/Redo</b>.
	<li>This is my first application with support for <b>internationalized
		translations (I18N)</b>.
</ul>



<p><br><a name="thirdparty"><h3>Third-party files</h3></a>

Regarding files in the <tt>src/include/thirdparty</tt>
directory: these are from sources outside of GXemul (such as NetBSD). 
The license texts in most cases say that "All advertising materials mentioning
features  or use of this software" must display acknowledgements. Even though I do 
<i>not</i> feel that I mention features or use of the header files (the 
"software") in any advertising materials, I am still very grateful for the 
fact that these people have made their files available for re-use, as Free 
software, so regardless of legal requirements, I guess thanking them like 
this is in order:<pre>
	debug_new.h, fast_mutex.h, and static_assert.h:
		Copyright (C) 2004-2005 by Wu Yongwei.
		(Also src/main/debug_new.cc.)

	exec_elf.h:
		This product includes software developed by the NetBSD
		Foundation, Inc. and its contributors.

	mips_cpuregs.h:
		From NetBSD.
</pre>

<p>See individual files for license details, if you plan to redistribute 
GXemul or reuse code.
