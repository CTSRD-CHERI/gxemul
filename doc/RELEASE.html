<h2>Release notes for GXemul 0.5.0</h2>

<p><i>Copyright (C) 2003-2008  Anders Gavare</i>


<p><br>GXemul is a framework for full-system computer architecture emulation. 


<p><br>The changes between release 0.4.6.x and 0.5.0 are:

<ul>

  <li>GXemul 0.5.0 is a complete rewrite of the emulator, in C++.
	(Previous versions were written in C.)
  <p>
  <li>A preliminary GTK+ GUI is now built-in.
  <p>
  <li>There are now finally <tt>install</tt> and <tt>uninstall</tt>
	makefile targets, which should simplify installation.
</ul>

<p>To build GXemul, you may need the following:
<ul>
	<li>The gtkmm libraries and header files (gtkmm-2.4 >= 2.12.1),
		for the GUI.
	<li>Doxygen, for building C++ class documentation.
</ul>

Both gtkmm and Doxygen are optional, GXemul will build without them.


<p><br>Super-short mini FAQ:

<p><b>Q:</b> Why C++? Why the rewrite/redesign?
<br><b>A:</b> I am more used to plain C, but I thought it would
be interesting to try to use C++ for a realistically-sized project.
Hello World is not realistically sized. I thought the emulator
would be a good project to work on. A rewrite was needed anyway,
since GXemul development had stagnated.


<p><br>To build the emulator, run the <tt>configure</tt> script, and then run 
<tt>make</tt>. This should work on most Unix-like systems, with few or no 
modifications to the source code.

<p>Regarding files in the <tt>src/include/</tt> directory: only some of 
these are written by me, the rest are from other sources (such as NetBSD). 
The license text says that "All advertising materials mentioning features 
or use of this software" must display acknowledgements. Even though I do 
<i>not</i> feel that I mention features or use of the header files (the 
"software") in any advertising materials, I am still very grateful for the 
fact that these people have made their files available for re-use, as Free 
software, so regardless of legal requirements, I guess thanking them like 
this is in order:<pre>
	debug_cpp.{h,cc}, fast_mutex.h, and static_assert.h are
