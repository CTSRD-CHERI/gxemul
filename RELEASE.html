<h2>Release notes for GXemul 0.4.7.2</h2>

<p><i>Copyright (C) 2003-2009  Anders Gavare</i>


<p><br>GXemul is a framework for full-system computer architecture emulation. 
Several processor architectures and machine types have been implemented. 
It is working well enough to allow <a href="doc/guestoses.html">unmodified
"guest" operating systems to run inside the emulator</a>,
as if they were running on real hardware.

<p>The emulator emulates (networks of) real machines. The machines may consist
of ARM, MIPS, Motorola 88K, PowerPC, and SuperH processors, and various 
surrounding hardware components such as framebuffers, busses, interrupt 
controllers, ethernet controllers, disk controllers, and serial port 
controllers.

<p>The <a href="doc/index.html">documentation</a> lists the machines and
guest operating systems that 
can be regarded as "working" in GXemul. The best working guest operating 
systems are <a href="doc/guestoses.html#netbsdpmaxinstall">NetBSD/pmax</a>
and <a href="doc/guestoses.html#netbsdcatsinstall">NetBSD/cats</a>.


<p><br>The changes between release 0.4.6.6 and 0.4.7 are:

<ul>

  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_88000">Motorola
	88K</a> emulation is now complete enough to run a guest
	operating system:
	<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/mvme88k.html">OpenBSD/mvme88k</a> 4.4.

	<p>A big thank you goes to Miod Vallat, who sent me physical
	88100 documentation, via snail mail. This has been invaluable
	when implementing the 88K emulation mode.

</ul>

<p><br>The changes between release 0.4.7 and 0.4.7.1 are:
<ul>

  <li>Applying a man page hypenation patch from Jonathan Wiltshire.
  <li>Minor documentation errors fixed.
  <li>Some more missing M88K instructions added.
  <li>NetBSD/hpcmips can now be installed and run using serial
	console (i.e. without -X), in addition to using the framebuffer.

</ul>

<p><br><b>The changes between release 0.4.7.1 and 0.4.7.2 are:</b>
<ul>

  <li><a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a> 5.0,
	<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> 4.5, and
  	<a href="http://www.helenos.org/">HelenOS</a> 0.4.0 have been released,
  	and the guest OS page has been updated to reflect this. (Not all
  	versions and architectures work; the versions listed on the
  	guest OS page are the latest ones that have been tested.)
  <li>A bug has been fixed which prevented configuration files from being used.
  
</ul>

<p>To build the emulator, run the <tt>configure</tt> script, and then run 
<tt>make</tt>. This should work on most Unix-like systems, with few or no 
modifications to the source code.

<p>Regarding files in the <tt>src/include/</tt> directory: only some of 
these are written by me, the rest are from other sources (such as NetBSD). 
The license text says that "All advertising materials mentioning features

<i>not</i> feel that I mention features or use of the header files (the 
"software") in any advertising materials, I am still very grateful for the 
fact that these people have made their files available for re-use, as Free 
software, so regardless of legal requirements, I guess thanking them like
