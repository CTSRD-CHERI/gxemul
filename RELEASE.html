<h2>Release notes for GXemul 0.4.6.6</h2>

<p><i>Copyright (C) 2003-2008  Anders Gavare</i>


<p><br>GXemul is a framework for full-system computer architecture emulation. 
Several processor architectures and machine types have been implemented. 
It is working well enough to allow <a href="doc/guestoses.html">unmodified
"guest" operating systems to run inside the emulator</a>,
as if they were running on real hardware.

<p>The emulator emulates (networks of) real machines. The machines may 
consist of ARM, MIPS, PowerPC, and SuperH processors, and various 
surrounding hardware components such as framebuffers, busses, interrupt 
controllers, ethernet controllers, disk controllers, and serial port 
controllers.

<p>The <a href="doc/index.html">documentation</a> lists the machines and
guest operating systems that 
can be regarded as "working" in GXemul. The best working guest operating 
systems are <a href="doc/guestoses.html#netbsdpmaxinstall">NetBSD/pmax</a>
and <a href="doc/guestoses.html#netbsdcatsinstall">NetBSD/cats</a>.


<p><br>The changes between release 0.4.6 and 0.4.6.1 are mostly
focused on documentation updates, to reflect new releases of
guest operating systems:

<ul>

  <li>OpenBSD 4.2 has been released. OpenBSD/landisk 4.2
	works in GXemul.

  <p>

  <li>NetBSD 4.0 has been released. The installation instructions
	in GXemul's documentation have been updated to reflect this.

	<p><ul>
	  <li>In most cases this simply means that NetBSD 4.0
		should work, in addition to NetBSD 3.1.
	</ul>

	<p>Some specifics worth mentioning are:

	<p><ul>
	  <li>For NetBSD/pmax, the change from 3.1 to 4.0 means that
		X Windows is now working again out-of-the-box. (Simply
		run <tt>startx</tt> as root to start X.)
	  <li>For NetBSD/arc, the supported version has jumped from
		1.6.2 to 4.0.
	  <li>NetBSD/landisk has been released, and works in GXemul.
	  <li>NetBSD/prep is unfortunately still at NetBSD 2.1.
	  <li>In some emulation modes, such as evbmips, hpcmips, and perhaps
		some more, NetBSD 4.0 uses
		the clock in a way which is not yet implemented in the
		emulator. (NetBSD 4.0 works, but NetBSD 3.1 worked better.)
	  <li>(I have not tried some of the "heavier" emulation setups,
		such as NetBSD/sgimips.)
	</ul>

</ul>

<p>The changes between release 0.4.6.1 and 0.4.6.3 are:

<ul>
  <li>Applying a patch from Oleksandr Tymoshenko for the wdc device, fixing
	the order of 16-bit words within 32-bit words in the identify struct,
  	and the error register is not cleared on reads any more.
  <li>The disk device used in the test machines can now access disk images
	larger than 4 GBs when emulating 32-bit architectures (as suggested
	by Julian Elischer).
</ul>

<p>The changes between release 0.4.6.3 and 0.4.6.5 are:
<ul>
  <li>For ARM emulation, a special case for PC-relative load which wasn't
	implemented before has now been implemented. (The problem could be
	triggered by attempting large builds using NetBSD's pkgsrc inside
	e.g. NetBSD/cats.)
  <li>The ARM 'bkpt' instruction has been implemented (patch from Jiri Svoboda).
</ul>

<p>The changes between release 0.4.6.5 and 0.4.6.6 are:
<ul>
  <li>Applying a patch from Kiyotaka Inaba which causes an ARM UND
	exception to be generated by the instruction word 0xe6000011,
	which is needed by gdb when running inside the emulator.
  <li>Fix for a free() bug in bootblock_iso9660.c.
  <li>OpenBSD/landisk installation instructions have been updated to 4.4.
  <li>Most NetBSD installation instructions have been updated to 4.0.1.
</ul>

<p>To build the emulator, run the <tt>configure</tt> script, and then run 
<tt>make</tt>. This should work on most Unix-like systems, with few or no 
modifications to the source code.

<p>Regarding files in the <tt>src/include/</tt> directory: only some of 
these are written by me, the rest are from other sources (such as NetBSD).

"software") in any advertising materials, I am still very grateful for the 
fact that these people have made their files available for re-use, as Free
