Overview  --  What is GXemul?
-----------------------------

GXemul is a framework for full-system computer architecture emulation. 



Quick start
-----------

To compile, type './configure' and then 'make'. This should work on most
Unix-like systems. If it does not, then please mail me a bug report.

Dependencies (optional):

	gtkmm-2.4 >= 2.12.1	for the GUI
	doxygen			for building C++ class documentation

You might want to experiment with various CC, CXX, and CFLAGS environment
variable settings, to get optimum performance.

Please read the rest of the documentation in the doc/ sub-directory for
more detailed information on how to use the emulator.



Feedback
--------

If you have found GXemul useful in some way, or feel like sending me
comments or feedback in general, then mail me at anders(at)gavare.se.
